# Wiredcraft Project Manager Test

Make sure you read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines in it.

## Requirements

You will be assigned a github issue ([we use github for everything](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/github-for-everything/)) which presents the outline of a small project. You will be tasked with:

• assessing and presenting your understanding of the scope.

• using your own methods a work breakdown structure for the project.

• finally an outline of the project plan as a whole.

This may be tailored to your application so read the initial description in your assigned Github issue carefully.


## What We Care About

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should aim for:

- Good use of established project management methodologies, we work in agile and scrum so if you pitch plans based on other methodologies you may want to provide some justification.

- Think of the requirements and aim to ask the right questions.

- We'll give you an outline of the development team you can work with, it's a good idea to keep this in mind when making the work breadown structure. 

- We're treating this as a test scenario of a hypothetical real-world case, so you can make requests for additional information or resources, pitch alternate solutions, and question the requirements and constraints. We'll be looking at your communication style as well. 



## FAQ's

* Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

From our application process you will have been provided to a link for a github issue for your specific task, you can follow up the task in github comments.

* What if I have question?

You can add it as a comment in the Github issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
